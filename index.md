## Welcome!
At Medical Computing Lab we build on our past and on-going work in dynamic decision making in complex and uncertain domains with limited resources. Together with our research collaborators, we are working on a family of representation, reasoning, and learning techniques and frameworks that can effectively reflect and better manage the incomplete and changing nature of real-world problems.
